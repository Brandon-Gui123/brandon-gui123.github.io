    content: |-
      Hi! I am a game developer who believes every bug might be a misunderstood feature. Some bugs make the cut and for the ones that don't,
      I fire up my debugging tools to hunt them down.

      During my free time, I work on my own personal projects. Some of which I try to re-create a game (or perhaps a certain gimmick of it) and
      others, I tinker around with new technologies just for fun and to try and understand things. Some of these projects are internal and cannot be
      distributed but I am happy to share more about those in private. Still, I am working on those projects so that they can be made open-source without
      any repercussions.

      Currently, I am a year 3 student studying at DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore in the Interactive Media and Game Development course to
      hone and refine my game development skills, especially level designing and working with C and C++.

      I am currently looking for internships from May 2026 to April 2027 so I greatly appreciate if you have opportunities to share.

              As an intern, I worked together in a team of 4 to create a proof-of-concept of a Security Operations Centre running in Virtual Reality (VR).

              This project is fun and interesting as there are many ways we can do this in VR and with the almost infinite space in the virtual world,
              there are lots of possibilities.

          What I learnt
            - The C and C++ programming languages and their power.
            - Game design principles so I can build better games and also go back in time to criticize myself on my older game projects.
            - Building game engines with other-like minded people so our games can run on it.
            - Having some idea on how operating systems work.

          What I am currently learning
            - Machine Learning and Python, a language that I somewhat dislike but am trying to change my mind.
            - Android app development, with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, a shiny new language.
            - Developing immersive web applications using Babylon.js so it can run in VR.

          The journey to a game developer begins here.

          What I learnt:
            - Java, which I find verbose but easy for me to follow.
            - C# which is used for developing games in Unity.
            - Unity, which we heavily use.
            - Some OpenGL and C++ so we know more than just Unity.
            - Developing Virtual and Augmented Reality applications for a more immersive experience.
